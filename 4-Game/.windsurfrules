# Project Guidelines – p5.js Steering Behaviors

## Global Behavior Rules
- Use steering behavior models inspired by Craig Reynolds
  (seek, flee, arrive, separation, alignment, cohesion, wander).
- Behaviors must be based on forces, acceleration, velocity.

## Architecture Constraints
- DO NOT modify `Vehicule.js`.
- `Vehicule.js` contains base properties and behaviors shared by all vehicles.
- New behaviors must be implemented using subclasses only.

## Inheritance Rules
- Subclasses may override:
  - applyBehaviors()
  - show()
- If update() is overridden, super.update() must be called.

## p5.js Rules
- Rendering logic must stay inside show().
- No direct position teleportation.
